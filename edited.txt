In 1948, a heated battle was underway in Texas for the second senate seat. In the Democratic primary, Coke Stevenson had a wide lead against his competitors and in a blue state, winning the primary was as good as winning the seat. As the previous governor of Texas, Stevenson was well regarded throughout Texas and drew mass appeal from his down-to-earth, cowboy persona. But, one of his opponents in the primary was none other than.
Despite a well-funded campaign backed by wealthy donors, Johnson was quite far behind in the polls. That was the case, at least, until he went one step beyond the others.
He commissioned a helicopter and started flying six days a week, hitting dozens of rural towns each day. Delivering his stump speech, Johnson drew crowds far larger than any that Stevenson had managed to muster throughout the entire course of the primary.
Johnson’s bold strategy paid off in a big way - it turned his whole campaign around.
His helicopter tour became known as the Miller City Windmill” and rural votes for the primary swayed increasingly in Johnson’s favor. After the ballots were counted and the dust had settled, Johnson emerged victorious and sealed the Texas senate election. From there, he went on to become the vice president, and eventually, the 36th president of the United States.
